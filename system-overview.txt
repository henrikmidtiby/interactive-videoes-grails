This document contains notes about the structure of the tekvideo.sdu.dk software.


# General structure

## Frontend
Polymer 3.0 is used to define components for the frontend 
* Interactive exercises (frontend/components/tve-renderer.js)
* Exercise editor (frondend/components/tv-exercise-editor.js)
* Navigation elements (frontend/components/tekvideo-exercise-card.js)
The polymer elements is built using the command 
cd frontend && polymer build
and the generated files are available in the frontend/build/default directory.
A simple webserver can be launched using the command
cd frontend/build/default && python3 -m http.server
There are currently no unittests on the frontend code, 
but small tests of a subset of the defined elements are 
available in the file frontend/tests.html

## Backend
Grails is used for the backend / serverside.

To run the server with https support (which is required for 
SDU Single Sign On to work), the following command should be used
grails run-app -https

## Mathquill
The mathquill

https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathquill



# Known issues

The math input field for the interactive exercises, renders 
badly on firefox but works fine on chrome.
I think it is an issue with the mathquill.css file and how it is loaded.


# Things to do

1. Map how events are dispatched and collected in the frontend and between the frontend / backend.
2. Include mathquill using npm
