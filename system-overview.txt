This document contains notes about the structure of the tekvideo.sdu.dk software.


# General structure

## Frontend
Polymer 3.0 is used to define components for the frontend 
* Interactive exercises (frontend/components/tve-renderer.js)
* Exercise editor (frondend/components/tv-exercise-editor.js)
* Navigation elements (frontend/components/tekvideo-exercise-card.js)
The polymer elements is built using the command 
cd frontend && polymer build
and the generated files are available in the frontend/build/default directory.
A simple webserver can be launched using the command
cd frontend/build/default && python3 -m http.server
There are currently no unittests on the frontend code, 
but small tests of a subset of the defined elements are 
available in the file frontend/tests.html

## Backend
Grails is used for the backend / serverside.

To run the server with https support (which is required for 
SDU Single Sign On to work), the following command should be used
grails run-app -https

# Known issues

The exercise editor does not work, however the import exercises from json works.

# Things to do

1. Map how events are dispatched and collected in the frontend and between the frontend / backend.
2. Ensure that the status of completed exercises are visualised in a proper way (https://localhost:8443/app/test-tve-group-renderer.html, show the list of exercises). This is properbly related to computed properties and the _computeCompletionIcon in tve-group-renderer.js
3. Change names of events to be more descriptive.
4. Look at markdown:renderHtml and issues with how scandinavian special characters are handled (they often look wrong on the course descriptions).
5. When starting a video on the site, the following error is shown: "Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'DOMWindow': The target origin provided ('https://www.youtube.com') does not match the recipient window's origin ('https://tekvideo.sdu.dk')."
7. Ensure that it is possible to add new exercises in the course management (through the tve-group-editor element). It is possible to import new exercises through the json importer. The exercise editor does not work at the moment.
